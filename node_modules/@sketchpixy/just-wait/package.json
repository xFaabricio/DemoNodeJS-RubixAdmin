  "readme": "# just-wait <sup><sub>v1.0.5</sub></sup>\n\n[![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/just-wait.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/just-wait) ![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/just-wait.svg) ![installs](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/just-wait.svg)\n\nWaits for a file or directory to change or appear, then just returns. The watched file or directory does not have to exist yet.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install --g just-wait\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Use --help or -h to see usage details\n$ just-wait --help\nUsage: just-wait [options]\n\n  Options:\n\n    -h, --help                  output usage information\n    -p, --pattern <pattern>     glob pattern. \",\" separates multiple patterns.\n                                More info: https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch\n    -d, --delay <milliseconds>  delay returning for a number of milliseconds\n    -t, --timeout <seconds>     timeout waiting after a number of seconds (default=30)\n    -s, --silent                supress logging.\n\n  Examples:\n\n    # watch \"lib\" dir, return when something changes\n    $ just-wait -p \"lib/**\"\n\n    # watch \"lib\" and \"src\" dirs, return 500ms after something changes\n    $ just-wait -p \"lib/**,src/**\" -d 500\n\n    # watch \"lib\" dir, timeout after 10 seconds\n    $ just-wait -p \"lib/**,src/**\" -t 10\n```\n\nIn the case of a timeout, `just-wait` will return with exit code `1`.\nIn other cases it will return with exit code `0`\n\n## Logging\nBy default `just-wait` will log two messages to the terminal to provide\nfeedback to the user:\n\n```bash\n$ just-wait -p README.md && echo Done!\nWaiting for README.md (max 30 seconds)\nReady. README.md changed\nDone!\n$\n```\n\nor, in the case of timeout:\n\n```bash\n$ just-wait -p README.md --timeout 10 && echo Done!\nWaiting for README.md (max 10 seconds)\nTimed out waiting for README.md after 10 seconds.\n$\n```\n\nIt uses [picolog](https://npmjs.org/package/picolog) for logging, which allows us\nto influence logging verbosity. The `Waiting for..` line is logged at level\n`WARN` (which means it is visible at picolog's default log level of `WARN`) and\nboth the success and error message are logged at level `ERROR`. You can change\nthe picolog log level by setting the environment variable `PICOLOG_LEVEL`, or you\ncan completely suppress logging by passing the `--silent` (or `-s`) flag.\n\n## Credits\nBased off of [Rick Wong](https://github.com/RickWong)'s [wait-run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-run),\nthis simplified version just waits for the file or directory to appear/change and then returns. It does not\nexecute any commands. Use it by chaining commands after it using `&&`, which works under *nix as well as Windows.\n\nCredits also go to [Fabian Eichenberger](https://github.com/queckezz), who created [watch-run](https://github.com/queckezz/watch-run),\nwhich was the basis for Rick's version.\n\nSpecial thanks to [Mark Reynolds](https://github.com/lostthetrail) for making all our lives easier with his [contribution](https://github.com/Download/just-wait/pull/1).\n\n## Copyright\n* © 2016, [Stijn de Witt](http://StijnDeWitt.com).
